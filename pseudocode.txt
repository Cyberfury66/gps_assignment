dcgps.c:
	- main():
		- Main function of the program
		- Mallocs the gps_data_t structure
		- Opens and starts the gpsd stream

	- exit():
		- Handles application termination
				- Frees memory
				- Closes the gpsd stream

gps-utils.c:
	- init_thread():
		- Creates and initializes GPS reading thread
		- Hands the GPS reading loop to the thread

	- gps_read():
		- Starts the main GPS reading loop
		- Sends sensor data to the gps_print() method in gpsprint.c
		- Passes the gps_data_t structure to gps_print() in gpsprint.c
	
	- check_errors():
		- Checks and handles errors from:
			- Sensor errors
			- Stream termination

		- Prints out errors to stderr

gpsprint.c:
	- gps_print():
		- Prints out the GPS data received in gps_read() in gps-utils.c
			- GPS data includes:
				- Time Stamp (UTC) 
				- Latitude/Longitude
				- PRN
				- Elevation
				- Azimuth
				- SNR
				- Used Flag (Y/N)

	- gps_print_location():
		- Gets information from gps_read() and prints out which "sector" the GPS is currently in

	- gps_show_world():
		- Prints out a map of the local area where the GPS is
